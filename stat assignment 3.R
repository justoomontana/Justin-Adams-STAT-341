1. Create 1000 random numbers and store them in a variable called variable1

2. calculate standard deviation, mean, and median 

3.save output of sd mean and median in R document along with your statement name and doc

variable1 <- runif(1000)
sd_variable1 <- sd(variable1)
mean_variable1 <- mean(variable1)
mean_variable1 <- mean(variable1)
1] 0.2915629
> mean(variable1)
[1] 0.5067384
> mean(variable1)
[1] 0.5067384
